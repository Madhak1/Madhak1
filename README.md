## 👋Hello! I am Malika (Madhak1 on GitHub)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a researcher with a passion for quantitative analysis and statistical modeling. I love working on projects that combine data, technology, and social impact. 

I have a PhD in Consumer Economics and a Masters in Statistics from the University of Georgia. In my recent research projects, I have 
  - investigated the spillover effects of parental health adversities on children's educational outcomes,
  - conducted predictive analysis of consumer behavior based on consumer lifetime value and extreme value theory,
  - assessed the impact of FAFSA workshops intervention amongst high school students in Alabama,
  - analyzed the Georgia Student Health Survey and the Educator Pipeline data and designed a dynamic data dashboard,
  - investigated college enrollment, retention, and graduation rates of students in US universities,
  - analyzed profiles of the members of the Financial Therapy Association.

I am currently working on a collaborative project investigating college enrollment, retention, and graduation rates of students in US universities. 

I have extensive experience working with both longitudinal and cross-sectional datasets. My expertise includes data exploration, manipulation, transformation, and visualization of large-scale datasets. I have successfully integrated and conducted complex analyses on datasets from diverse domains, demonstrating a strong proficiency in handling substantial data volumes.

I am well-versed in working with major datasets such as the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Educator Pipeline Data from the Georgia Department of Education, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) from the National Center for Education Statistics, and the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) from the Federal Reserve Board.

I am experienced in conducting, evaluating, and explaining statistical analysis using R, SAS, Stata, SPSS, JMP, and Python. I am skilled in linear and non-linear regression analysis, panel data and fixed effects models, logit and probit models, univariate and multivariate analysis, cluster and factor analysis, time series analysis, count data model, forecasting and predictive analysis, extreme value analysis, expectation maximization algorithms, biostatistics, and simulations.

I am proficient in translating complex data into impactful insights through visualizations using tools like Looker Studio, with a strong foundation in visualization principles easily transferable to other visualization softwares.
